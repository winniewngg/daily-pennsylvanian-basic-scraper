```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation

This robots.txt file allows all crawlers but imposes a 10-second crawl delay to manage traffic occurring on the site. It explicitly blocks SemrushBot, likely to prevent third-party marketing tools. 
However, it opens access to other webscrapers looking to access the site!
